<p>Listen, Hey you recriter this is fat middle fuck you creating a simple website and deploying out on cloud with webserver hosted on cloud. this is done is 7 simple hrs.</p>
<p>That is defination of engineering for you people you people bullshit with data structures as if you all know from day you were born!!. Considering everyone highest rank on codechef not thinking about mental implication on the applicant. But it is not your mistake you are bred that way. Cancerous shitty education forced upon people to learn and vomit. Judging on CGPA, "arrey bhaishab agar wohi stream padhna hota toh phele nahi padh lete". Take aptitude to judge mental prowness of candidate. What about the mental shit you give to us. Even worse not giving feedback were candidate gone wrong. You all fuckers learning/using machine learning stop using, teaching "machine" to learn from errors and human himself not applying in his own lyf.</p>
<p>Next come HR well you all peeps never, tum lite lelo. Tum pe rant karne ka fayyda bhi nahi hai. Tum jindagi bhaar yehi karoge.</p>
<p>I paid 2 Lakh for my coaching 2 years learned loved all things, college mein net 12 lakh learnt everything from ourseleves, and then proff says you all hopeless. So college peeps listen proffs are attention whores more than you gf's. Buddho ko bolo ki inki bass ki nahi hai. Arrogant as fuck. I learned more math from 3Blue1Brown than you people. He is earning shit these motherfuckers.... funny how world works. I never thought maths has such attachment to nature.</p>
So hey HR people there 4 para in english there just so you know. I just might know enough english to write these lines.</p>
<p>Hey recrutries I am ENGINEER, who could dynamically learn new things we are most organic data structure out there yet you want maps, n-ary trees.</p>
<p>This my rant towards world, fuck it.</p>
